Q. What is the difference between a Deployment and a StatefulSet in Kubernetes?
Q. When should you use a StatefulSet instead of a Deployment?
Q. Can you attach a volume to a Deployment? If yes, how is it different from a StatefulSet?
Q. What could cause a StatefulSet pod to fail when rescheduled to a different availability zone?
Q. How do PV/PVC behave across zones in EKS or Kubernetes in general?
Q. What is a DaemonSet and when would you use it?
Q. If you want two pods per node (instead of one), what alternatives to DaemonSet can you use?
Q. What is a Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) and how is it useful?
Q. How do you handle certificate rotation in on-prem Kubernetes clusters?
Q. What are the challenges with scheduling pods in a multi-node, multi-AZ setup?
Q. How does the Kubernetes scheduler decide where to place pods?
Q. What happens when a StatefulSet pod cannot mount its volume after moving to another node?
Q.A pod is in the Running state, but users see 502s. What now?
Healthy ≠ Ready. Time to look at readiness probes, DNS, and app logs.
Q. kubelet is healthy, but new pods don’t schedule. Why?
Can you reason through taints, node pressure, and CNI readiness?
Q. Helm upgrade corrupted your PVCs. Rollback strategy?
Hint: helm rollback isn’t always a safe exit.
Q. Logs are missing for OOMKilled pods. How do you recover?
Forensic debugging 101, sidecars, centralized logging, and ephemeral volumes.
Q. You see 10 Pending pods but 5 idle nodes. Explain.
Node affinity? Resource requests? Stuck init containers?
Q. How would you design cross-region K8s HA with low RTO?
Talk multi-region DNS, storage sync, stateful failover, and observability.
Q. Your HPA isn’t scaling. Prometheus shows 80% CPU. RCA path?
Metrics server? API throttling? Cooldowns?
Q. eBPF shows dropped packets in the cluster. What now?
Time to trace CNI plugins, kernel versions, and underlying network policies.
Q. The systemd service in a node fails silently. Pods are degraded. Debug?
Can you correlate journald logs with pod behavior?
Q. Your dev team wants self-service namespaces. What’s your RBAC + Quota plan?
The real test of engineering maturity is governance with velocity.
Q. Where do you configure min and maximum pod?
Q. How do you check how many pods were started?
Q. What are life cycles of a pod?
Q. If any pods were failing to start, how do you start troubleshooting?
Q. Explain, how do min and max pod configuration In load balancing?
Q. How does a kubernetes know when to spin up an additional pod? Give the configuration
Details.
Q. Explain about cluster in kubernetes.

Q. Ingress and egress configuration. Explain in detail. How would you configure it.
Q. How would you configure routing of application to accept ingress.
Q. How do you handle database creeds in eks or k8?
